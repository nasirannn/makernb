When fans talk about 90s R&B, the conversation often turns to Usher, Boyz II Men, Mary J. Blige, or Toni Braxton. But hidden within that golden era was another remarkable talent: Sam Salter. With his smooth tenor, gospel roots, and songwriting brilliance, Salter carved out a space in R&B history — even if his name didn't always reach the mainstream spotlight.

## Who Was Sam Salter?

Sam Salter, born February 16, 1975, in Los Angeles, grew up immersed in gospel music at the Faithful Church of God in Christ. Gospel molded his voice into something soulful and heartfelt, with echoes of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. By his teens, he was winning talent shows, which eventually opened doors into the professional music world.

## Signing with LaFace Records

In the mid-90s, Salter's demo tapes reached L.A. Reid, who quickly signed him to LaFace Records — the powerhouse label behind TLC, Usher, and Toni Braxton. With producers like Babyface, Tricky Stewart, and Laney Stewart on board, Salter began recording what would become his debut album.

## The Debut Album: It's On Tonight (1997)

Released in September 1997, It's On Tonight showcased Salter's silky falsetto and heartfelt storytelling.

- "After 12, Before 6" became his signature hit, breaking into the Top 20 on the R&B charts.
- "There You Are" also gained traction, highlighting his ability to deliver slow jams that resonated with late-90s R&B lovers.
- The title track, "It's On Tonight," rounded out an album filled with intimate grooves and smooth production.

While it didn't dominate the charts, the album won him a loyal fan base and critical respect.

## The Lost Album: Little Black Book

By 1999, Salter had finished his sophomore project, Little Black Book. The lead single, "Once My Sh.. (Always My Sh..)," hinted at a bolder, edgier sound. Unfortunately, internal issues at LaFace led to the album being shelved, a fate many promising R&B artists of that era faced.

But the songs didn't disappear. Other artists recorded them:

- Sisqó's No. 1 smash "Incomplete" was originally a Sam Salter song.
- Boyz II Men's ballad "Color of Love" also came from Salter's pen.

Even without his own second album, Sam's songwriting ensured his music reached millions.

## Songwriting Legacy and Independent Work

After leaving LaFace, Salter reinvented himself behind the scenes. He wrote for stars like Tyrese, 98 Degrees, B2K, Deborah Cox, and Charlie Wilson, proving his versatility and deep understanding of R&B.

He also released independent material, including:

- "Straight 2 Heaven" and "Got Me" (2010)
- "To Be Loved" (2011)
- Collaborations like "Mayday" (2013), "Bye Bunny (2017)", and "Under the Veil" (2019)

Though more low-key, these projects showed his dedication to music and his fans.

## Passing and Legacy

On August 27, 2021, Sam Salter passed away at just 46 years old. His death was a shock to the R&B community, with tributes pouring in from fans and fellow artists. He may not have sold millions of records, but his influence ran deep — especially through the songs he wrote that others turned into classics.
